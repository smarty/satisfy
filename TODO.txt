Optional command line argument for download behavior:
  -manifest=(local|remote) where local is the default value.
  This would allow manifest files to be checked on the cloud side
  but then never downloaded locally. During each run, the cloud version
  would be considered canonical.

Allow packages to be signed. In other words, allow a non-interactive
  GPG agent to sign the contents of a package and to add that signature
  to...the manifest? (e.g. inline signatures). As long as a signature
  cannot be forged, then it can safely live anywhere. This specifically
  is for things such as "locally installed" packages that are end-user
  accessible, e.g. local downloads for APIs and data.
